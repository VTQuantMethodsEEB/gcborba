  The dataset contains daily landing fisheries from the Amazon River Basin and the hydrological matrix. The data cover from 1993 to 2006 and have information for the main principal tributaries of the Amazon River. Fishing data includes variables such as date, common name species, boat, tributary river, effort, and yield. Hydrological data includes minimum, maximum, duration, and water levels (high and low waters). All hydrological information came from Brazil's National Water Agency (ANA) for the same period used for the fish catch.
